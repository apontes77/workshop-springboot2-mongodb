# workshop-springboot2-mongodb
In this project I make a simple application that simules a social media with a little amount of users, posts and comments. 

The architecture used here is REST - Representational State Transfer, a default for building API's proposed by Roy Fielding in his doctoral
thesis. The database used was MongoDB, a NoSQL database  based on documents in JSON format.
